# Module 12 â€“ JS & Plotly - Belly Buttons
# Unit Challenge
For this unit challenge, we have built a small website, using HTML, JavaScript, and the JS library Plotly. We have been given a dataset showing the collected data for a study of belly buttons. The study shows different parameters that were part of this study. 

In the webpage you can select the subject ID. The page dinamycally loads the metada and results for that subject. 

As part of the challenge, we have been asked to customize the original page, which was provided as part of the course. The customizations are:

1. Updated layout for the page
2. Added a Navbar with links to the different graphs in the document
3. Responsive design
4. Added a few colors of my liking

You can visit the page here: and download the code by cloning the repository on your local computer.
